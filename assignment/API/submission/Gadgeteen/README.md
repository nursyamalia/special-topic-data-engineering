<h1 align="center"> Open Weather API </h1>

<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather</a>  is a service that provides weather data through an API (Application Programming Interface). The OpenWeatherMap API allows developers to access current, forecast, and historical weather data for any location on Earth, as well as weather maps, satellite imagery, and other weather-related information.

With the Open Weather API, developers can integrate weather information into their applications, websites, and services. The API provides real-time weather data, hourly and daily forecasts, historical weather data, and more.

The Open Weather API uses a RESTful interface, which means that developers can interact with the API using standard HTTP methods, such as GET and POST, and retrieve data in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The API is available in both free and paid versions, with different levels of access and data limits.

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to collect weather data from the OpenWeather API using Python, and then save the collected data as an Excel file and also in MongoDB. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing weather trends or building weather forecasting models.

The project requires the use of an API key from OpenWeather, which is used to connect to their API and collect weather data. Once the data is collected, it is saved as an Excel file using Python's pandas library, and also saved in MongoDB using the PyMongo library.

Overall, this assignment requires knowledge of Python programming, working with APIs, data manipulation with pandas, and working with MongoDB.
