Simmons, Betty Gilpin, Sam Richardson, Edwin Hodge, Jasmine Mathews, Keith Powers","In December 2022, biology teacher and former Green Beret, Dan Forester, fails to get a job at the Army Research Laboratory. During the broadcast of the World Cup, soldiers from the year 2051 arrive to warn that, in their time, humanity is on the brink of extinction due to a war with alien invaders, referred to as the ""Whitespikes."" In November 2048, the Whitespikes suddenly appear in northern Russia and proceed to kill the majority of the humans within three years. In response, the world's present-day militaries are sent into the future via a wormhole device called the ""Jumplink,"" but fewer than 30% survive their seven-day deployment, prompting an international draft.

Dan receives his draft notice and tells his wife Emmy and daughter, Muri. Emmy suggests that they should run and talks Dan into visiting his estranged father James, a mechanical engineer, for help in removing the draft band attached to his arm. Dan's father left him and his mother after he returned from the Vietnam War because he felt he was too dangerous to remain with them. Dan says he does not want his father's help and leaves. Dan reports to basic training with other draftees where they are briefed by future soldiers. Dan deduces with fellow draftee Charlie, a scientist, that all draftees have died before the war starts to prevent a paradox.","uploads/movie-1.png?v=1640157585",NULL,"2021-07-02","2021-12-22 11:19:12","2021-12-22 15:19:45"

During an operation, a team of United States Marines and robotic soldiers, individually referred to by the acronym ""G.U.M.P."", are ambushed. Disobeying an order, drone pilot 1st Lt. Harp deploys a Hellfire missile in a drone strike against a suspected enemy launcher, killing two Marines caught in the killzone but saving the 38 Marines who would have been killed by the launcher. As punishment, Harp is sent to Camp Nathaniel, the US base of operations in Ukraine where he is assigned to Captain Leo, a highly advanced and experimental android super-soldier masquerading as a human officer.

Harp and Leo set out on a mission to prevent terrorist Victor Koval from gaining control of a network of Cold War–era nuclear missile silos, under the cover of delivering vaccines to a refugee camp. On the way, they respond to a reported attack on a friendly aid truck, resulting in a stand-off between the Marines and armed locals. After a G.U.M.P. shoots a local who threw a rock, Captain Leo negotiates a peaceful solution by giving the locals the contents of the aid truck. However, pro-Russian insurgents ambush the locals and Marines, leading to a firefight. This forces Leo and Harp to travel to the refugee camp on foot, while the Marines remain behind to engage the insurgents.

After arriving at the refugee compound, Leo and Harp are shot at by an insurgent, who kills some civilians. Leo tortures the insurgent for information, before leaving him to be killed by the gathered mob. Leo and Harp meet their contact Sofiya, a resistance leader. Sofiya leads them to an arms dealer who knows the location of a bank vault containing nuclear launch codes that Koval is looking for. Harp and Leo travel to the bank and are met by Koval's forces which include several G.U.M.P.s. While Harp helps rescue civilians caught in a crossfire between US and Russian G.U.M.P.s, Leo retrieves the codes but cannot find Koval. A drone strike called in by Eckhart destroys the bank and several buildings, leading the military command to believe both Koval dead and Leo destroyed.

Harp reunites with Leo who tells him that he has his own plans for the codes, and has been manipulating Harp into helping him evade the eye of military command. He knocks out Harp and leaves him on the side of the road where he is picked up by Sofiya's men. Leo meets with Koval to give him the codes but kills him when Koval refuses to give Leo access to a nuclear missile silo. Harp informs Sofiya and his commander of Leo's actions, and they realize that Leo is planning to launch the nuclear missiles to strike the United States, in order to prevent them from fighting more wars in the future. Harp volunteers to infiltrate the silo and finds Leo has taken over. He disables Leo but not before Leo initiates the launch of a missile, explaining that his goal was for the android super-soldier program to end in failure. Harp escapes as the silo is destroyed by a drone strike before the missile can launch; destroying Leo. Harp returns to Camp Nathaniel and receives praise from his commander, who informs him that he is returning home. Harp then leaves the base.","uploads/movie-2.png?v=1640157558",NULL,"2021-01-15","2021-12-22 14:07:45","2021-12-22 15:19:18"
