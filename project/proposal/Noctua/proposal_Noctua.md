## Key components
The following are the key components of a data science project proposal:

## üìë Executive Summary:

Anwar Ibrahim has been involved in Malaysia's political scene since more than three decades ago. He also has gone through a lot of challenges during that time. Now that he finally becomes Malaysia's 10th Prime Minister, Malaysians have their says and views towards the newly appointed Prime Minister. In this project, we will perform a sentiment analysis to observe what people on social media, mainly on Reddit thinks about Anwar Ibrahim. Posts and comments from Reddit will be extracted and scrapped as a dataset, so that words thrown can be classified into three sentiments: positive, natural and negative.

## üèöÔ∏è Background:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://sabahmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/KNC_0080-scaled.jpg" height="600"></img>
</p>
Anwar Ibrahim is a prominent political figure in Malaysia who has served as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister in the past. He is currently the leader of the Pakatan Harapan coalition and is seen as a potential candidate for Prime Minister of Malaysia.

There are varying opinions about Anwar Ibrahim's suitability as a Prime Minister, with some people supporting him and others expressing concerns about his past controversies. Given the polarizing nature of politics in Malaysia, it is essential to conduct a sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion about Anwar Ibrahim as a potential Prime Minister.

Sentiment analysis is a computational technique that involves using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze large volumes of textual data and determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed within the text. In the case of Anwar Ibrahim, sentiment analysis can help to identify the prevailing public opinion about his suitability as a Prime Minister, as well as the key factors influencing people's perceptions of him.

To conduct a sentiment analysis about Anwar Ibrahim as a potential Prime Minister, one would need to gather a large dataset of relevant textual data, such as news articles, social media posts, and online comments. This dataset would then need to be processed using natural language processing techniques to extract meaningful features such as sentiment, emotion, and opinion. Finally, machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks could be used to train a sentiment classifier model that could accurately classify sentiment in new textual data.

## ü•Ö Goals and Objectives

Problem Statement:
We talked about Anwar Ibrahim, as a politician and Prime Minister. It is not a secret that he has been through a lot of controversies in the past although he finally made his way back into the political scene. People from anywhere in the world, not just Malaysia, talked so much about Anwar Ibrahim whether it is a compliment or otherwise. He is a well known person around the world. His comeback into politics and becoming the Prime Minister has become a talking point and hot debate amongst people on social media, including Reddit. 

The significance of this project lies in its potential to provide valuable insights of Redditor's view towards Anwar Ibrahim. sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights into the prevailing public opinion about Anwar Ibrahim as a potential Prime Minister, which can inform political decision-making and public discourse. Below are our goals in conducting this project.

- To determine whether the public has positive or negative sentiment on our Prime Minister. 
- To determine the talking point regarding Anwar Ibrahim.
- To analyze the percentage used word based on the words written on social media. 
- To train a model that can successfully identify a positive or negative comment on Reddit.
- To make a prediction on whether or not Anwar Ibrahim can sustain his job as a Prime Minister.

In this project, we aim to observe public's opinion on our Prime Minister using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## üç° Risks and Limitations:

<p align="center">
<img src="SentimentAnalysisLimitation.png" height="400"></img>
</p>

1. Subjectivity and Tone

The use of NLP techniques for sentiment analysis has limitations when it comes to subjective language and tone. For example, the sentiment of a text may be influenced by the subjective nature of certain predicates, such as adjectives and verbs, which may not be treated equally in sentiment analysis. As a result, the sentiment analysis of Anwar Ibrahim's public perception may not fully capture the nuances of subjective language and tone in media coverage, speeches, and social media posts.

The subjective nature of language and tone may pose a challenge to accurately and objectively measure the sentiment of Anwar Ibrahim's public perception. For instance, the sentiment of a text that uses subjective language, such as "inspiring leader" or "corrupt politician," may vary depending on the individual's personal biases and beliefs. Therefore, NLP techniques used for sentiment analysis should be used with caution and in conjunction with human interpretation to account for the subjectivity and tone of the text.

Another challenge in sentiment analysis of Anwar Ibrahim's public perception is the potential for language ambiguity. Words and phrases may have multiple meanings, which can affect the sentiment analysis. For example, the word "concerned" could be used to express positive or negative sentiment depending on the context. Therefore, it is important to take into account the broader context and use domain-specific knowledge to properly interpret the sentiment of a text.

2. Context and Polarity

Context is a crucial factor in sentiment analysis, as all utterances are made in some context, such as time, place, and audience. Analyzing sentiment without context can be challenging, as it can lead to incorrect polarity or sentiment analysis results. For example, the same response, such as "Everything about it," can have different sentiment polarity depending on the context of the question asked. Therefore, it is essential to take into account the context of the text to obtain accurate sentiment analysis results.

Changes in polarity can occur due to changes in the context of the text. For instance, a positive sentiment response to a question about liking an event can become a negative sentiment response when the question is changed to disliking the event. This change in polarity can affect the accuracy of sentiment analysis results. Preprocessing or postprocessing techniques may be necessary to account for context and changes in polarity in sentiment analysis.

Preprocessing or postprocessing techniques can be used to capture context and polarity in sentiment analysis. However, determining which techniques to use can be challenging, as there is no straightforward approach to capturing context and polarity. Domain-specific knowledge and human interpretation may be required to properly preprocess or postprocess data for sentiment analysis.

3. Irony and Sarcasm

When analyzing sentiments expressed towards Anwar Ibrahim, it is important to consider the use of irony and sarcasm, as these devices can greatly affect the polarity of the text. For example, a statement like "Anwar Ibrahim is the most honest politician I've ever seen. NOT!" may seem positive at first, with the use of "most" and "honest," but the "NOT!" at the end suggests a negative sentiment. This type of language can be especially prevalent in political discourse, where individuals may use irony or sarcasm to express negative opinions about a political figure without stating it directly.

However, detecting irony and sarcasm in sentiment analysis on Anwar Ibrahim can be challenging due to the complexity of language and the importance of context. An NLP technique like sarcasm and irony detection algorithms may be necessary to identify and analyze these devices, but human analysis and interpretation are still crucial for accurate results. Therefore, it is important to consider both the words used and the context in which they are used to accurately analyze sentiment towards Anwar Ibrahim.

4. Comparisons

When analyzing sentiment towards Anwar Ibrahim, comparisons can present a challenge in sentiment analysis. For example, a statement like "Anwar Ibrahim is a better politician than his predecessor" may seem positive at first glance, but it can also be dependent on the context of the comparison. If Anwar Ibrahim's predecessor was widely regarded as corrupt, then the comparison would have a positive sentiment. However, if the predecessor was highly respected, the comparison could have a negative sentiment.

Similarly, a statement like "Anwar Ibrahim's policies are better than nothing" could be interpreted as either positive or negative depending on the context. If the alternative was seen as worse or nonexistent, then the sentiment could be positive. However, if there were better alternatives available, the sentiment could be negative.

Therefore, when analyzing sentiment towards Anwar Ibrahim with comparisons, it is important to consider the context and implications of the comparison in order to accurately determine the sentiment.

5. Emojis

There are two types of emojis according to Guibon et al.. Western emojis (e.g. :D) are encoded in only one or two characters, whereas Eastern emojis (e.g. ¬Ø \ („ÉÑ) / ¬Ø) are a longer combination of characters of a vertical nature. Emojis play an important role in the sentiment of texts, particularly in tweets.

When it comes to sentiment analysis, emojis can add a lot of value to understanding the overall sentiment of a text, particularly in social media platforms such as Twitter. Emojis can often convey emotions and attitudes that are difficult to express through words alone.

However, treating emojis in sentiment analysis can be challenging due to the large number of emojis available and the different ways they can be interpreted. As mentioned earlier, there are two types of emojis, Western and Eastern, and they can be encoded differently.

Therefore, in order to effectively analyze sentiment in social media content, it is important to preprocess the text and transform emojis into tokens that can be recognized and analyzed as part of the overall sentiment. Whitelisting them, i.e. always taking them as a feature for classification purposes, can also improve the performance of sentiment analysis.

It is important to note that not all emojis have a clear sentiment attached to them, and their sentiment can depend on the context in which they are used. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the overall context of the text in which an emoji is used when analyzing sentiment.

6. Defining Neutral

When analyzing the sentiment towards Anwar Ibrahim, it is important to define what we mean by neutral in order to perform accurate sentiment analysis. Defining categories like neutral, positive, or negative can significantly impact the performance of sentiment analysis models. One way to identify and define neutral texts is to look at objective texts that do not contain explicit sentiments. Another approach is to consider irrelevant information that has not been preprocessed to filter out noise. However, caution is advised when including such information as it could negatively impact the performance of the classifier. Additionally, texts containing wishes can be tricky to categorize, particularly those that involve comparisons such as "I wish Anwar Ibrahim was more decisive."

7. Human Annotator Accuracy

Sentiment analysis is a tremendously difficult task even for humans, including when it comes to analyzing the sentiment towards Anwar Ibrahim. On average, inter-annotator agreement (a measure of how well two (or more) human labelers can make the same annotation decision) is pretty low for Anwar Ibrahim's sentiment analysis. And since machines learn from labeled data, sentiment analysis classifiers might not be as precise for Anwar Ibrahim as they are for other types of classifiers.

If you are new to sentiment analysis related to Anwar Ibrahim, then you‚Äôll quickly notice improvements. For typical use cases related to Anwar Ibrahim, such as analyzing public opinion about his political career, monitoring his brand image, and understanding his followers' opinions, you‚Äôll save a lot of time and money on tedious manual tasks by using sentiment analysis tools.

## üéì Conclusion:
We believe our data science project is in fact crucial to analyze the performance of our new prime minister. We can then know whether the citizens of Malaysia are satisfied or not with our new government despite the political instability in our country. Some of the potential limitations that might arise are various issues that come out day-by-day. Public sentiment could be changed according to the issue either positive or negatively. However, we believe that the amount of supporters or haters will remain as it is. Lastly, we do not expect the project will sail smoothly as there would be some challenges which we would expect to arise such as the model not working as intended. Fortunately, we could always ask our lecturer for any assistance.
